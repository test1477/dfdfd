The issue arises because the current script does not yet extract artifact versions and artifact instance details. These details may not be available from the `api/storage/<repo_name>` endpoint directly and might require querying artifact-specific metadata through another API endpoint.

To address this:

1. **Artifact Version**:
   - Versions are typically part of the artifact's path or retrieved from metadata.
   - If your repository follows a standard structure (e.g., `repo_name/artifact/version`), you can parse the version from the artifact path.

2. **Artifact Instance**:
   - This field isnâ€™t directly available from the API unless your JFrog instance provides a custom property or metadata.
   - You may need to consult your JFrog administrator for more details on where to find this data.

Below is an updated version of the script that includes additional logic to infer `version` and handle `artifact_instance` as a placeholder.

### Updated Script: Extracting Version and Handling Artifact Instance

ARTIFACTORY_TOKEN = 'your_artifactory_api_token'  # Replace with your actual API token

        package_type = repo.get("packageType", "N/A")  # npm, Docker, etc.

        # Fetch artifact details for the repository
        artifacts_data = fetch_artifacts(repo_name)

        if "children" in artifacts_data:  # Check if the repository has artifacts
            for artifact in artifacts_data["children"]:
                artifact_path = artifact.get("uri", "N/A")
                artifact_url = f"{JFROG_URL}/{repo_name}{artifact_path}"
                version = infer_version(artifact_path)  # Infer version from the path
                created_date = artifacts_data.get("created", "N/A")
                artifact_instance = "frigate.jfrog.io"  # Placeholder for artifact instance

                repo_details.append([
                    repo_name, repo_type, package_type, artifact_path.strip("/"), version,
                    artifact_url, created_date, "N/A", artifact_instance
                ])
        else:
            # If no artifacts are found, append basic repository information
            repo_details.append([
                repo_name, repo_type, package_type, "N/A", "N/A",

            ])

    return repo_details

# Function to save the extracted data into a CSV file
def save_to_csv(data, filename='jfrog_repositories.csv'):

    with open(filename, mode='w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)

    main()
```

### Key Updates:

1. **Version Extraction**:
   - The `infer_version` function attempts to extract the version from the artifact path, assuming that one segment in the path looks like a version (e.g., `1.0.0` or `v1.2`).
   - If no version-like segment is found, it defaults to `"N/A"`.

2. **Artifact Instance**:
   - The `artifact_instance` field is hardcoded as `"frigate.jfrog.io"` since this value might represent your JFrog instance.

3. **Package Name**:
   - Extracted directly from the artifact path by stripping the slashes (`/`).

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - The script handles cases where artifacts are not available for a repository.

### Example Output:

For a repository `npm-repo` containing the following artifacts:

```plaintext
npm-repo/
    lodash/
        4.17.21/
            lodash-4.17.21.tgz
    react/
        17.0.2/
            react-17.0.2.tgz
```

The CSV output would look like this:

| Repo Name | Repo Type | Package Type | Package Name        | Version  | URL                                        | Creation Date | License | Artifact Instance   |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|---------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------|---------------|---------|---------------------|
| npm-repo  | local     | npm          | lodash/4.17.21      | 4.17.21  | https://frigate.jfrog.io/npm-repo/lodash   | N/A           | N/A     | frigate.jfrog.io    |
| npm-repo  | local     | npm          | react/17.0.2        | 17.0.2   | https://frigate.jfrog.io/npm-repo/react    | N/A           | N/A     | frigate.jfrog.io    |

### Limitations:
1. **Artifact Metadata**:
   - To fetch metadata like creation date, license, and specific package types, you may need to call additional JFrog APIs (e.g., the AQL API).
   - Let me know if you'd like to extend the script for these details.

2. **Static `artifact_instance`**:
   - If you need a dynamic artifact instance value, provide more context about how to extract or compute this field.

Let me know how this version works for you!
