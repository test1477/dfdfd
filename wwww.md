If the script is taking a long time to execute, it’s likely because it’s making a large number of sequential HTTP requests to fetch metadata for each package. To speed it up, we can use **parallel processing** to fetch metadata concurrently. This can be achieved using Python's `concurrent.futures` module, which allows us to run tasks in parallel using threads or processes.

Here’s the updated script with **parallel processing** to speed up execution:

### Updated Script with Parallel Processing

```python

            futures.append(

### Key Changes for Speed Improvement:
1. **Parallel Processing**:
   - The `ThreadPoolExecutor` is used to fetch package metadata concurrently.
   - Each package's metadata is fetched in a separate thread, allowing multiple HTTP requests to run in parallel.

2. **Thread Pool Size**:
   - The `MAX_THREADS` variable controls the number of concurrent threads. You can adjust this based on your system's capabilities and network bandwidth.

3. **Efficient Repository Processing**:
   - Repositories are processed sequentially, but packages within each repository are processed in parallel.

---

### Performance Considerations:
- **Network Latency**:
  - The script's performance is heavily dependent on network latency and the Artifactory server's response time.
  - Parallel processing reduces the total time by overlapping network requests.

- **Thread Pool Size**:
  - Increasing `MAX_THREADS` can speed up the script, but too many threads may overwhelm the Artifactory server or your network.
  - Start with a small number (e.g., 10) and gradually increase it while monitoring performance.

- **Error Handling**:
  - If a request fails, the script logs the error and continues processing other packages.

### Example Output (CSV):
| Repo Name   | Package Type | Package Name     | Version | URL                                      | Created Date       |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|---------|------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| npm-repo    | npm          | my-package       | 1.2.3   | https://artifactory/.../my-package-1.2.3 | 2023-10-01 12:34:56 |
| docker-repo | docker       | my-image         | latest  | https://artifactory/.../my-image-latest  | N/A                |
| helm-repo   | helm         | my-chart         | 0.1.0   | https://artifactory/.../my-chart-0.1.0   | 2023-09-29 14:15:16 |

### Additional Optimization Tips:
1. **Batch Requests**:
   - If the Artifactory API supports batch requests, you can fetch metadata for multiple packages in a single request.

2. **Caching**:
   - Cache metadata for packages that don’t change frequently to avoid redundant requests.

3. **Pagination**:
   - If the repository contains a large number of packages, implement pagination to fetch packages in smaller batches.

4. **Asynchronous Requests**:
   - For even better performance, consider using an asynchronous HTTP library like `aiohttp` instead of `requests`.
