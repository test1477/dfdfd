If the script is taking significantly longer to execute compared to the earlier version, the issue is likely related to the following:

1. **Fetching Metadata for Each Artifact**:
   - For every artifact, the script makes a separate API call to fetch metadata using `/api/storage/<repo_name>/<artifact_path>`.
   - This can drastically increase execution time, especially for repositories with a large number of artifacts.

2. **Excessive API Requests**:
   - The increased number of requests to the Artifactory API may cause delays due to network latency or API rate limits.

3. **Recursive Artifact Listing**:
   - If a repository contains a large number of artifacts or deeply nested structures, the recursive listing (`list&deep=1`) can contribute to the delay.

---

### Optimizations to Reduce Execution Time

To improve the performance of the script:

1. **Batch Metadata Fetching**:
   - Instead of fetching metadata for each artifact, rely on the metadata returned by the recursive listing (`?list&deep=1`) API. This will eliminate the need for additional API calls.

2. **Skip Unnecessary Fields**:
   - Extract only the required details (e.g., `artifact_path`, `created_date`) directly from the recursive listing response.

3. **Parallelize API Requests**:
   - Use Python's `concurrent.futures` or `asyncio` to fetch data concurrently, reducing the total runtime.

### Optimized Script: Batch Metadata Processing

Hereâ€™s an updated script that processes metadata in batches by relying on the recursive listing:

```python
import requests
import csv
import warnings
from urllib.parse import urljoin

# Suppress SSL verification warnings
from requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions import InsecureRequestWarning
warnings.simplefilter('ignore', InsecureRequestWarning)

# JFrog Artifactory instance details
JFROG_URL = 'https://frigate.jfrog.io/artifactory'  # Base URL for JFrog
ARTIFACTORY_TOKEN = 'your_artifactory_api_token'  # Replace with your API token

# Headers for the API request
headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {ARTIFACTORY_TOKEN}',
    'Accept': 'application/json',
}

# Function to fetch all repositories
def fetch_repositories():
    """
    Fetches a list of all repositories in the Artifactory instance.
    """
    url = f"{JFROG_URL}/api/repositories"
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, verify=False)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        print(f"Failed to fetch repositories: {response.status_code}")
        return []

# Function to list all artifacts in a repository
def list_artifacts(repo_name):
    """
    Recursively fetches all artifacts in the specified repository.
    """
    url = f"{JFROG_URL}/api/storage/{repo_name}?list&deep=1"
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, verify=False)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json().get("files", [])
    else:
        print(f"Failed to list artifacts for {repo_name}: {response.status_code}")
        return []

# Function to process repository artifacts without extra API calls
def process_repository(repo_name, package_type):
    """
    Processes all artifacts in a repository using batch metadata from the recursive listing.
    """
    artifact_list = list_artifacts(repo_name)
    repo_details = []

    for artifact in artifact_list:
        artifact_path = artifact.get("uri", "")
        artifact_url = urljoin(f"{JFROG_URL}/{repo_name}", artifact_path)
        created_date = artifact.get("lastModified", "N/A")

        # Parse package name and version from artifact path
        segments = artifact_path.strip("/").split("/")
        if len(segments) >= 2:
            package_name = f"{repo_name}/{'/'.join(segments[:-2])}"  # Up to the version folder
            version = segments[-2]  # Second-to-last segment
        else:
            package_name = repo_name
            version = "N/A"

        # Append details
        repo_details.append({
            "repo_name": repo_name,
            "package_type": package_type,
            "package_name": package_name,
            "version": version,
            "url": artifact_url,
            "created_date": created_date,
            "artifactory_instance": "frigate.jfrog.io"
        })
    
    return repo_details

# Function to save data to CSV
def save_to_csv(data, filename='jfrog_artifact_metadata.csv'):
    """

    """
    headers = ['repo_name', 'package_type', 'package_name', 'version', 'url', 'created_date', 'artifactory_instance']
    
    with open(filename, mode='w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=headers)
        writer.writeheader()
        writer.writerows(data)
    
    print(f"Data has been written to {filename}")

# Main function to process all repositories
def main():
    """
    Main function to process all repositories and extract metadata.
    """
    repositories = fetch_repositories()
    all_repo_details = []

    for repo in repositories:
        repo_name = repo.get("key")
        package_type = repo.get("packageType", "N/A")  # Dynamically fetch the package type
        print(f"Processing repository: {repo_name} (Type: {package_type})")
        
        # Process repository artifacts in batches
        repo_details = process_repository(repo_name, package_type)
        all_repo_details.extend(repo_details)

    # Save all details to CSV
    save_to_csv(all_repo_details)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Key Improvements:

1. **Batch Metadata Fetching**:
   - The script relies entirely on the `?list&deep=1` endpoint to fetch artifact details in bulk, avoiding the need for separate API calls for each artifact.

2. **Eliminated Per-Artifact Metadata Calls**:
   - No more `/api/storage/<repo_name>/<artifact_path>` calls for each artifact. This reduces API overhead significantly.

3. **Faster Execution**:
   - The script processes metadata directly from the recursive listing response, cutting down execution time for large repositories.

---

### Expected Runtime:

- This optimized script should reduce execution time significantly, bringing it closer to your earlier runtime of ~5 minutes, depending on the number of artifacts.

---

### Next Steps:

1. **Test the Script**:
   - Replace `your_artifactory_api_token` with your actual API token.
   - Run the script and verify the runtime and output.

2. **Check the CSV Output**:
   - Ensure that the `package_name`, `version`, and other fields are extracted correctly.

3. **Parallelize for Further Optimization** (Optional):
   - If needed, I can help you parallelize repository processing using Python's `concurrent.futures`.
