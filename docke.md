To delete CSV files that are older than 7 days in the JFrog Artifactory `/reports/ev` repository, you can use the JFrog CLI or `curl` to first list the files, check their dates, and then delete the older ones. JFrog Artifactory does not directly support the `find` command like a local filesystem, so you'd have to interact with the Artifactory REST API to get the list of files and their metadata.

Hereâ€™s how you can update the workflow to delete files older than 7 days from the `/reports/ev` repository on JFrog:

### Updated workflow with file deletion in JFrog Artifactory:

```yaml
name: Generate JFrog Reports

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 9 * * *"  # Runs daily at 9 AM UTC
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allows manual triggering

jobs:
  generate-report:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set Up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.9"

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: pip install requests

      - name: Run Report Script for EV
        env:
          JFROG_API_KEY_EV: ${{ secrets.JFROG_API_KEY_EV }}
        run: |
          echo "Generating report for EV..."
          python report_script.py --org ev --jfrog-url "https://frigate.io/artifactory" --output reports/ev || echo "EV report generation failed"
          ls -lh reports/ev || echo "EV directory is empty"

      - name: Run Report Script for PPA
        env:
          JFROG_API_KEY_PPA: ${{ secrets.JFROG_API_KEY_PPA }}
        run: |
          echo "Generating report for PPA..."
          python report_script.py --org ppa --jfrog-url "https://ppa.jfrog.io/artifactory" --output reports/ppa || echo "PPA report generation failed"
          ls -lh reports/ppa || echo "PPA directory is empty"

      - name: Validate Reports Before Upload
        run: |
          ls -lh reports/ev || echo "EV report missing"
          ls -lh reports/ppa || echo "PPA report missing"

      - name: Delete Old EV Reports from JFrog (older than 7 days)
        env:

          echo "Deleting CSV files older than 7 days in JFrog /reports/ev..."
          # List the files in the reports/ev repository and check their creation date
          files=$(curl -s -H "X-JFrog-Art-Api:${JFROG_API_KEY_EV}" "https://frigate.io/artifactory/api/storage/reports/ev?list&listFolders=0" | jq -r '.files[] | select(.uri | test(".csv$")) | .uri')
          for file in $files; do
            # Get the file details and check the last modified date
            last_modified=$(curl -s -H "X-JFrog-Art-Api:${JFROG_API_KEY_EV}" "https://frigate.io/artifactory/api/storage/reports/ev$file" | jq -r '.lastModified')
            last_modified_timestamp=$(date -d "$last_modified" +%s)
            current_timestamp=$(date +%s)
            diff=$(( (current_timestamp - last_modified_timestamp) / 86400 ))  # Difference in days
            if [ $diff -gt 7 ]; then
              # Delete the file if it is older than 7 days
              echo "Deleting $file (older than 7 days)"
              curl -X DELETE -H "X-JFrog-Art-Api:${JFROG_API_KEY_EV}" "https://frigate.io/artifactory/reports/ev$file" || echo "Failed to delete $file"
            fi
          done

      - name: Upload Reports to JFrog (EV)
        env:
          JFROG_API_KEY_EV: ${{ secrets.JFROG_API_KEY_EV }}
        run: |
          if [ -f "reports/ev/EV_EOL_$(date +%m-%d-%Y).csv" ]; then
            echo "Uploading EV report..."
            curl -H "X-JFrog-Art-Api:${JFROG_API_KEY_EV}" -T reports/ev/EV_EOL_$(date +%m-%d-%Y).csv "https://frigate.io/artifactory/reports/ev/EV_EOL_$(date +%m-%d-%Y).csv" || echo "EV upload failed"
          else
            echo "EV report file not found, skipping upload."
          fi

      - name: Upload Reports to JFrog (PPA)
        env:
          JFROG_API_KEY_PPA: ${{ secrets.JFROG_API_KEY_PPA }}
        run: |
          if [ -f "reports/ppa/EV_EOL_$(date +%m-%d-%Y).csv" ]; then
            echo "Uploading PPA report..."
            curl -H "X-JFrog-Art-Api:${JFROG_API_KEY_PPA}" -T reports/ppa/EV_EOL_$(date +%m-%d-%Y).csv "https://ppa.jfrog.io/artifactory/reports/ppa/EV_EOL_$(date +%m-%d-%Y).csv" || echo "PPA upload failed"
          else
            echo "PPA report file not found, skipping upload."
          fi
```

### Key changes:
1. **Deleting old files from JFrog**:
   - The workflow fetches the list of CSV files in the `/reports/ev` repository using the JFrog Artifactory Storage API.
   - It checks the `lastModified` date for each file, calculates the difference from the current date, and deletes files that are older than 7 days.
   - Uses `jq` to parse JSON responses and `curl` to delete the files.

### Notes:
- Make sure you have the `jq` tool installed on the runner since it's used to parse the JSON response from Artifactory.
- The script uses the `X-JFrog-Art-Api` header to authenticate requests, and the `DELETE` method is used to remove old files.

This workflow will now delete CSV files in `/reports/ev` older than 7 days from the JFrog repository before uploading the new reports.
