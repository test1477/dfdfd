The issue persists because there is still a formatting error in the repository line in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/octopus.com.list`. Specifically, the problem lies in the **missing space** between the URL (`https://apt.octopus.com/stable/`) and the component (`main`). The line:

```
deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/octopus.gpg] https://apt.octopus.com/stable/main
```

is incorrect because there is no space between `stable/` and `main`. The correct format requires a space:

```
deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/octopus.gpg] https://apt.octopus.com/stable/ main
```

---

### **Fix**
Update the repository line to include the required space between the URL and the component.

---

### **Updated Workflow**

Hereâ€™s the corrected GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Octo CLI Install Test

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  Deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Check out repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0

    - name: Install dependencies and Octopus CLI
      run: |
        # Update package list and install necessary packages
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install --no-install-recommends gnupg curl ca-certificates apt-transport-https -y

        # Download and add the Octopus Deploy GPG key (without displaying it on the terminal)
        curl -sSfL https://apt.octopus.com/public.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/octopus.gpg

        # Add the Octopus repository entry to the apt sources list (correct format)
        echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/octopus.gpg] https://apt.octopus.com/stable/ main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/octopus.com.list

        # Update the package list again to include the Octopus repository
        sudo apt update

        # Install the Octopus CLI package
        sudo apt install -y octopuscli

    - name: Verify Octopus CLI installation
      run: |
        # Verify if Octopus CLI is installed and working
        octo --version
```

---

### **Key Fix**
The repository line is now correctly formatted with a space between the URL and the component:

```
deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/octopus.gpg] https://apt.octopus.com/stable/ main
```

---

### **Debugging Steps**
If the error persists, follow these steps to debug:

1. **Check the Repository File**:
   - Verify the contents of `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/octopus.com.list`:
     ```bash
     cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/octopus.com.list
     ```
   - Ensure it contains:
     ```
     deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/octopus.gpg] https://apt.octopus.com/stable/ main
     ```

2. **Check the GPG Key File**:
   - Verify that the GPG key file exists:
     ```bash
     ls -l /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/octopus.gpg
     ```

3. **Manually Run `sudo apt update`**:
   - Run the following command to check for errors:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     ```

4. **Check for Extra Spaces or Characters**:
   - Ensure there are no extra spaces, invisible characters, or line breaks in the repository file. You can use `cat -A` to display hidden characters:
     ```bash
     cat -A /etc/apt/sources.list.d/octopus.com.list
     ```

---

### **Expected Outcome**
- The malformed entry error will be resolved.
- The Octopus CLI will be installed successfully.
- The `octo --version` command will confirm the installation.

---

### **Additional Notes**
- The warning about `114 packages can be upgraded` is unrelated to the Octopus CLI installation. It simply indicates that there are system packages that can be upgraded. You can ignore this for now, or add a step to upgrade all packages:
  ```bash
  sudo apt upgrade -y
  ```

- The warning `WARNING: apt does not have a stable CLI interface` is a general notice from APT and does not affect the functionality of the workflow.

---

### **Final Check**
If the issue still persists, please share the exact contents of `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/octopus.com.list` and the output of the following commands:

```bash
cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/octopus.com.list
ls -l /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/octopus.gpg
sudo apt update
```

This will help me diagnose the problem further. Let me know!
