The error you're encountering (`Malformed entry 1 in list file /etc/apt/sources.list.d/octopus.com.list (Component)`) indicates that the `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/octopus.com.list` file has an incorrect format. Additionally, the PGP public key block is being displayed on the terminal, which is not ideal.

Let's address both issues step by step:

---

### **1. Fixing the Malformed Entry in `octopus.com.list`**
The malformed entry error occurs because the repository line in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/octopus.com.list` is not formatted correctly. The correct format for a repository entry is:

```
deb <repository-url> <distribution> <component>
```

For Octopus Deploy, the correct entry should be:

```
deb https://apt.octopus.com/stable/ main
```

Make sure there are no extra spaces, invalid characters, or missing fields.

---

### **2. Preventing the PGP Public Key from Displaying on the Terminal**
The PGP public key is being displayed because the `curl` command is outputting the key directly to the terminal. Instead, we can redirect the output to a file using `tee` or `gpg --dearmor`.

---

### **Updated Workflow**

Hereâ€™s the corrected GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Octo CLI Install Test

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  Deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Check out repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0

    - name: Install dependencies and Octopus CLI
      run: |
        # Update package list and install necessary packages
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install --no-install-recommends gnupg curl ca-certificates apt-transport-https -y

        # Download and add the Octopus Deploy GPG key (without displaying it on the terminal)
        curl -sSfL https://apt.octopus.com/public.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/octopus.gpg

        # Add the Octopus repository entry to the apt sources list (correct format)
        echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/octopus.gpg] https://apt.octopus.com/stable/ main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/octopus.com.list

        # Update the package list again to include the Octopus repository
        sudo apt update

        # Install the Octopus CLI package
        sudo apt install -y octopuscli

    - name: Verify Octopus CLI installation
      run: |
        # Verify if Octopus CLI is installed and working
        octo --version
```

### **Key Changes and Fixes**

1. **Correct Repository Format**:
   - The repository entry is now correctly formatted as:
     ```bash
     deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/octopus.gpg] https://apt.octopus.com/stable/ main
     ```
   - This ensures that the `signed-by` option is used to associate the GPG key with the repository, and the `main` component is specified correctly.

2. **Prevent PGP Key Display**:
   - The GPG key is now processed using `gpg --dearmor` and saved to `/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/octopus.gpg`. This avoids displaying the key on the terminal.

3. **Repository Update**:
   - After adding the repository, `sudo apt update` is run to refresh the package list and include the Octopus repository.

4. **Install Octopus CLI**:
   - The `octopuscli` package is installed using `sudo apt install -y octopuscli`.

5. **Verification**:
   - The `octo --version` command is used to verify that the Octopus CLI is installed and working.

---

### **Why These Changes Work**
- The `signed-by` option ensures that the GPG key is explicitly associated with the repository, which is a best practice for modern APT usage.
- The `gpg --dearmor` command converts the ASCII-armored PGP key into a binary format, which is required for `/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/`.
- The repository entry is now correctly formatted, so APT can read it without errors.

---

### **Expected Outcome**
- The workflow will no longer display the PGP public key on the terminal.
- The malformed entry error will be resolved.
- The Octopus CLI will be installed successfully, and `octo --version` will confirm the installation.
