The piece of code you provided earlier was working because it used the older `apt-key` method for adding GPG keys, which is now deprecated in newer versions of Ubuntu and Debian. The newer versions of these distributions recommend using the `signed-by` method instead of `apt-key`.

However, if the older method worked for you and you want to revert to it, you can use the following workflow. Note that this is not recommended for long-term use, as `apt-key` is deprecated and may be removed in future versions.

### **Workflow Using `apt-key` (Deprecated Method)**

```yaml
name: Install Octo.exe

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  Deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Check out repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0

    - name: Install dependencies and Octopus CLI
      run: |
        # Update package list and install necessary packages
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install --no-install-recommends gnupg curl ca-certificates apt-transport-https -y

        # Add the Octopus Deploy GPG key using the deprecated apt-key method
        curl -sSfL https://apt.octopus.com/public.key | sudo apt-key add -

        # Add the Octopus repository entry to the apt sources list
        sudo sh -c "echo deb https://apt.octopus.com/stable/ main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/octopus.com.list"

        # Update the package list again to include the Octopus repository
        sudo apt update

        # Install the Octopus CLI package
        sudo apt install -y octopuscli

    - name: Verify Octopus CLI installation
      run: |
        # Verify if Octopus CLI is installed and working
        octo --version
```

---

### **Key Differences**
1. **GPG Key Handling**:
   - The GPG key is added using the deprecated `apt-key` method:
     ```bash
     curl -sSfL https://apt.octopus.com/public.key | sudo apt-key add -
     ```

2. **Repository Entry**:
   - The repository entry is added directly to `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/octopus.com.list` using `sudo sh -c`:
     ```bash
     sudo sh -c "echo deb https://apt.octopus.com/stable/ main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/octopus.com.list"
     ```

3. **No `signed-by` Option**:
   - The `signed-by` option is not used, as the key is added globally using `apt-key`.

---

### **Why This Works**
- The `apt-key` method adds the GPG key to a global keyring, which allows APT to verify packages from the Octopus repository.
- The repository line is correctly formatted with a space between the URL (`https://apt.octopus.com/stable/`) and the component (`main`).

---

### **Why This is Not Recommended**
- **`apt-key` is Deprecated**:
  - The `apt-key` command is deprecated in newer versions of Ubuntu and Debian. It may be removed in future releases.
  - Using `apt-key` adds the GPG key to a global keyring, which is less secure than associating the key with a specific repository using the `signed-by` option.

- **Security Risks**:
  - Global keyrings can lead to security vulnerabilities, as any repository using the same key can be trusted by APT.

---

### **Recommended Approach**
If possible, use the `signed-by` method as shown in the earlier workflows. However, if you need a quick fix and are using an environment where `apt-key` still works, the above workflow will resolve the issue.

---

### **Debugging Tips**
If the issue persists:
1. **Check the Repository File**:
   - Verify the contents of `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/octopus.com.list`:
     ```bash
     cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/octopus.com.list
     ```
   - Ensure it contains:
     ```
     deb https://apt.octopus.com/stable/ main
     ```

2. **Check the GPG Key**:
   - Verify that the GPG key was added successfully:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-key list
     ```

3. **Manually Run `sudo apt update`**:
   - Run the following command to check for errors:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     ```

---

### **Expected Outcome**
- The Octopus CLI will be installed successfully.
- The `octo --version` command will confirm the installation.
