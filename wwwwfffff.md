The workflow you've provided looks well-structured for installing Octopus CLI (`octopuscli`) on an Ubuntu runner. However, there may be issues with installing dependencies or the key management part that might be causing errors.

Let me suggest a couple of improvements:

### **1. Update Key Management:**
The `apt-key` command is deprecated and might be causing issues in newer Ubuntu versions. Instead, you should manage keys in the `/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/` directory. Here's an updated section to handle key management properly.

### **2. Include Dependency Fix:**
The error you're facing might stem from a missing dependency, so adding extra steps to install the necessary dependencies for Octopus CLI might help.

### Updated Workflow:

```yaml
name: Octo CLI Install Test

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  Deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Check out repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0

    - name: Install dependencies and Octopus CLI
      run: |
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install --no-install-recommends gnupg curl ca-certificates apt-transport-https -y

        # Install Octopus Deploy's GPG key
        curl -sSfL https://apt.octopus.com/public.key | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/octopus.asc

        # Add Octopus repository
        sudo sh -c "echo deb https://apt.octopus.com/stable main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/octopus.com.list"

        # Update the package lists again to include Octopus repository
        sudo apt update

        # Install Octopus CLI
        sudo apt install -y octopuscli

    - name: Verify Octopus CLI installation
      run: |
        octo --version
```

### **Changes Made:**
1. **GPG Key Management**: Replaced `apt-key add` with `tee` to store the GPG key in `/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/` (as `apt-key` is deprecated).
2. **Package Installation**: Added `-y` to `apt install` commands to automatically confirm installation.
3. **Verification Step**: Added a step to check if `octopuscli` is installed successfully by running `octo --version`.

### **Summary:**
This workflow updates key management and verifies the installation of the Octopus CLI. It should help resolve issues related to the GPG key deprecation and missing dependencies during installation. Let me know if you encounter any issues with this updated workflow!
