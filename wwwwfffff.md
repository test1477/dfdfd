The error you're encountering indicates a problem with the entry in the `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/octopus.com.list` file. The issue is likely related to a malformed entry or a missing component after adding the Octopus repository URL.

Let's correct the repository URL format.

### Issue:
The error message suggests that there might be a syntax error in how the Octopus repository is added. Specifically, the "Component" part is missing or misconfigured.

### Fix:
The correct format for adding a repository source should be something like this:
```
deb https://apt.octopus.com/stable main
```

Make sure the line that is written into `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/octopus.com.list` is correctly formatted.

### Updated Workflow:

```yaml
name: Octo CLI Install Test

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  Deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Check out repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0

    - name: Install dependencies and Octopus CLI
      run: |
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install --no-install-recommends gnupg curl ca-certificates apt-transport-https -y

        # Install Octopus Deploy's GPG key
        curl -sSfL https://apt.octopus.com/public.key | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/octopus.asc

        # Add Octopus repository correctly
        sudo sh -c "echo deb https://apt.octopus.com/stable main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/octopus.com.list"

        # Update the package lists again to include Octopus repository
        sudo apt update

        # Install Octopus CLI
        sudo apt install -y octopuscli

    - name: Verify Octopus CLI installation
      run: |
        octo --version
```

### Key Updates:
1. **Repository URL**: Ensure the entry in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/octopus.com.list` is formatted as `deb https://apt.octopus.com/stable main` (with no extra spaces or incorrect components).
2. **Re-run Update**: Ensure `sudo apt update` is called after adding the repository to refresh the package list.

### Explanation:
- The `deb https://apt.octopus.com/stable main` line should be properly written to the list file. Ensure there are no typos, extra spaces, or characters in the entry.
- The key (`public.key`) is added to the trusted key directory (`/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/`) to allow secure fetching from Octopus's repository.

Try this updated version of the workflow, and let me know if it resolves the issue!
