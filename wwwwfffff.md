The error you're seeing (`Malformed entry 1 in list file /etc/apt/sources.list.d/octopus.com.list (Component)`) indicates that the `octopus.com.list` file has an incorrect format, specifically with the "Component" field.

### To fix this, you can ensure that:

1. The repository URL is written correctly without extra or malformed components.
2. The GPG key handling should be done without outputting the public key to the terminal.

Let's go over a step-by-step fix:

### Updated Workflow:

```yaml
name: Octo CLI Install Test

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  Deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Check out repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0

    - name: Install dependencies and Octopus CLI
      run: |
        # Update package list and install necessary packages
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install --no-install-recommends gnupg curl ca-certificates apt-transport-https -y

        # Install the Octopus Deploy GPG key (to avoid displaying the key on the terminal)
        curl -sSfL https://apt.octopus.com/public.key | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/octopus.asc

        # Add the Octopus repository entry to the apt sources list (correct format)
        echo "deb https://apt.octopus.com/stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/octopus.com.list

        # Update the package list again to include the Octopus repository
        sudo apt update

        # Install the Octopus CLI package
        sudo apt install -y octopuscli

    - name: Verify Octopus CLI installation
      run: |
        # Verify if Octopus CLI is installed and working
        octo --version
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Fixing the repository line**: The repository entry in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/octopus.com.list` is now correctly written without any extra components.
   
   ```bash
   echo "deb https://apt.octopus.com/stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/octopus.com.list
   ```

2. **GPG key installation**: The GPG key is added to `/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/octopus.asc`, avoiding any terminal output of the key itself.
   
   ```bash
   curl -sSfL https://apt.octopus.com/public.key | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/octopus.asc
   ```

3. **Verifying Octopus CLI**: After installation, the version of the Octopus CLI is checked with `octo --version` to confirm it installed correctly.

### Explanation of the Error:
The malformed entry error occurs because an incorrect component (e.g., an extra space, invalid field) was present in the repository file `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/octopus.com.list`. The corrected repository URL in the command above ensures that only the `deb` and `main` components are present.

### Outcome:
- The public key will not be printed in the terminal.
- The repository URL is correctly formatted in the list file, so the package manager can read it without issues.
- The workflow will install Octopus CLI successfully.
